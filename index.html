    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>I am a student at UTD, and my major is in ATEC.</p>
    <h2>Selections from CWD Index</h2>
    <h2><a href="https://www.termsandconditions.game/">termsandconditions.game</a></h2>
    <p>I never like having to sort through a bunch of pop-ups when I visit a site for the first time, but when you turn it into a game and take it to the extreme like this, it becomes pretty fun!</p>
    <h2><a href="http://kathack.com/">Katamari Hack</a></h2>
    <p>Katamari Damacy is cool. This is cool too. It's pretty amazing how you can turn any site into a mini Katamari Damacy game.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://thefreemovie.buzz/">thefreemovie.buzz</a></h2>
    <p>This looks and sounds absolutely terrible, but that's what makes it so fascinating.</p>
